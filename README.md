# Branch Efficiency Analysis

## Project Description 
In an organisation it is commonplace for some branches to outperform others in terms of resource utilization, revenue generation, and overall operational effectiveness. The lack of a systematic method for assessing and addressing these disparities hinders the organization's ability to maximize its potential and deliver consistent value across all branches. Therefore, the problem at hand is to quantify their relative efficiency using the DEA-CCR and DEA-BCC method and develop targeted strategies to enhance overall branch performance.
The primary objective of the "Branch Efficiency" project is to assess and identify the most efficient branches within an organization and provide insights for enhancing the performance of less efficient branches. By employing the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method with the Constant Returns to Scale (CCR) model, the project aims to measure the relative efficiency of each branch and propose actionable strategies to improve overall operational effectiveness.

## The methodology of the same is as follow- 
Step 1 – Data collection – Comprehensive synthetic data on KPIs for each branch is created. 
Step 2- Selection of variables – Relevant Inputs and Outputs that contribute to the efficiency of the branch are identified and selected. Inputs could include variables such as number of employees, branch size and operating cost. And outputs could include factors like number of clients, revenue generated and customer satisfaction rating.
Step 3- DEA- CCR and BCC model is utilised to assess the relative efficiency of the branches. This involves determining the efficiency scores by solving a linear program with constraints.
Step 4- Identification of the benchmark branch – The branches that exhibit the highest efficient score are identified and used as a reference for comparison. They represent the best practices in operational efficiencies. 
Step 5- Identification of inefficiencies- Factors contributing to the inefficiencies of less efficient are analysed and area for improvements are highlighted.
The proposed solution aims to address the identified inefficiencies in branch performance within the organization through a systematic and data-driven approach.
